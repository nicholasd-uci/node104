# node104
Node104 is all about fine tuning our AJAX server-side skills and practicing object oriented programming. We give one example of a simple writeFile and how to render it in an HTML document. In addition we also go over Constructors and how to better organize our code with Constructors.

> In addition to being able to create a .txt file, we can also make an HTML doc with the writeFile method.
