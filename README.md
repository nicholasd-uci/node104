# node104

```
Node104 is all about fine tuning our AJAX server-side skills and practicing object oriented programming. We give one example of a simple writeFile and how to render it in an HTML document. In addition we also go over Constructors and how to better organize our code with Constructors. 
```

## writeFile to an HTML document

> In addition to being able to create a .txt file, we can also make an HTML doc with the writeFile method. 

> By doing so we can edit the way the html would be displayed by using `temp literals`
